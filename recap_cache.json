They could get five days off, if the Nuggets beat the Thunder on Thursday to force a Game 7 in the other West semifinal series.\nBrandin Podziemski had a playoff career-high 28 points for the Warriors, who again played without star Stephen Curry because of the hamstring strain that forced him out of the second quarter in Game 1 and took the heart out of their entire offensive operation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything away from what Minnesota just accomplished,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cNo sense in even talking about Steph.\u201d\nJonathan Kuminga provided another energy boost off the bench with 26 points, but Podziemski\u2019s performance came too late and the production from Jimmy Butler and Buddy Hield was consistently too little after they led the series-opening win.\nGolden State presented far more of a defensive challenge than the Los Angeles Lakers did for Minnesota during their five-game series in the first round, but the collection of every-level scorers the Wolves can throw at an opponent when they\u2019re moving the ball and pushing the pace simply wore down the Warriors over the course of the series.\nRudy Gobert was a force around the rim with 17 points, Mike Conley had 16 points and eight assists, and Donte DiVincenzo snapped out of a slump with 13 points as the Wolves shot a staggering 77% on 2-pointers (36 for 47). They set franchise postseason records for assists (36) and field goal percentage (62.8%).\nSeries close-out games can sometimes be the toughest to win, but the Wolves played with a ferocity paired with their shooting touch that all but portended victory. Randle kept up his superb postseason, providing a constant source of energy and production.\nThe Wolves stretched their lead as high as 25 points in the third quarter, large enough to withstand a late Warriors push that pulled them to 99-90 with 7:11 left. But Edwards answered with a 3, and the crowd started mixing \u201cWolves in 5!

Fortunately, I thought his shot made it pretty much an even game and if we came out with the type of purpose that we needed to I felt we were going to be OK.\u201d\nNow, it's back home to Minneapolis for the Wolves with a chance to clinch the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series in Game 5 on Wednesday night.\nThe Warriors will still be without Stephen Curry, who sat out his third game in a row and is scheduled to have his strained left hamstring re-evaluated that day.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to Superman this thing,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cIf he\u2019s in a place where he can play, I\u2019m sure he will.\u201d\nEdwards made consecutive 3-pointers and scored 11 total points in a decisive 17-0 Minnesota run that put the Timberwolves ahead 85-68 late in the third.

Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday.\nThe big question: Will Curry will be available? The league's career-leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that.\nKerr frequently sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off.\n\u201cPeople are going to try to blame whatever, blame whoever,\u201d said star Anthony Edwards, who had one point in the first half. \u201cThey can blame me. I just didn\u2019t play good enough.\u201d\nThe Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter.\nEdwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after the rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third.\n\u201cWe had opportunities to run out.

He then made two free throws as the Warriors pulled within 86-84.\nBut the Warriors couldn't keep it going. With a balanced effort on both ends - including 17 points and hustle plays by big man Steven Adams off the bench - Houston had an answer nearly every time Golden State threatened or made a big play.\nThe Warriors led 3-1 in the series but fell behind in a hurry in a 131-116 Game 5 loss Wednesday night as Houston\u2019s offense rolled after averaging 98 points through the first four games of the series.\nVanVleet was brilliant again. He shot 7 for 13 from the floor after consecutive games going 8 for 13, and he converted all nine of his free throws - he's a perfect 22 of 22 at the line over the series. And from 3-point range the past three games, he's 18 for 27.\nThat's why Kerr went to defensive specialist Gary Payton II in the starting lineup in place of Brandin Podziemski.\nDraymond Green picked up an offensive foul at the 8:53 mark of the first quarter for shoving Jalen Green. The play went to review and the foul was determined to be a flagrant-1. But after two straight games with dustups, both teams stayed poised.\n\u201cIt was a mantra going into the series: Play through everything,\u201d Udoka said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a physical game.
